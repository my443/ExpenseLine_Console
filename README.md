# ExpenseLine Console

## Purpose

The purpose of this work is to model out exactly what an expense claim app will look like before moving it into something with a UI.

I will model and test everything with code first. Then when it is following the business rules and flows that I expect, I can put it into a Blazor app. 
One of the things I want to do with this app is to test it thoroughly. I will be working on writing tests for everything throughout.
